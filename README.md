#MQTT Web Client
In this repo you will found a basic implementation of the MQTT client *mqttjs*(https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js)
for reporting and acting over many esp devices with both sensors and actuators.
This project is intended to serve as a guide for feature mobile and spa implementations, and not as a final product himself.

##MQTT topic structure
- The root topic is "users".
  `/users`

- Each user has his own domain under the root topic followed by his username.
  `/user/alice`

- Each devices has his own id (`ESP.getChipId()`) and will be next to the username in the topic structure.
  `/user/alice/12601668`

- Each device has sensors, actuators or both, in the case of the sensors, will be found under the "sensor"
  topic followed by an alias for each kind of sensor (humidity, temperature, luminosity).
  `/user/alice/12601668/sensor/temperature`

- Each device actuator will be both listen and publishing to his alias(by default relay1, relay2) under
the "actuator" domain.
 `/user/alice/12601668/actuator/relay1`

##Device/Client communication protocol
- Each request must include the basic authorization data (username and password).

- On a new client connection the client will request to each device from the user to report to the mqtt broker.
 `/users/alice/report`

- On a "report" request each device will publish to the "register" topic.
 `/users/alice/12601668/register`

- The client will subscribe to the user parent topic listening for all published data tho his child topics as a
sensor or an actuator.
 `/users/alice/#`

- The client will publish data to an actuator topic on every time a user requires it.
 `/user/alice/12601668/actuator/relay1`

##Payload schema
- The sensors will publish data with this schema:
  `{
    "value": float,
    "origin": string
  }`

- The actuators will publish and listen for this schema:
  `{
    "value": boolean,
    "origin": string
  }`
